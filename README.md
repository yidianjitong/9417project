We download data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data, and follow the rule in Kaggle to implement our code.
<br>
<br>File lists in submission.zip:
<br>
```submission.py```
```pre_processing.py```
```readme.md```
```submission.csv``` and
```report.pdf```.

#### Environmental requirements:
Python 3.7.4
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install re
pip install scipy
pip install time
```
After that you should run ```submission.py``` to implement our code.
